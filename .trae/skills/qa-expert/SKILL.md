# QA Expert

Establish world-class QA testing processes for any software project using proven methodologies from Google Testing Standards and OWASP security best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when:
- Setting up QA infrastructure for a new or existing project
- Writing standardized test cases (AAA pattern compliance)
- Executing comprehensive test plans with progress tracking
- Implementing security testing (OWASP Top 10)
- Filing bugs with proper severity classification (P0-P4)
- Generating QA reports (daily summaries, weekly progress)
- Calculating quality metrics (pass rate, coverage, gates)
- Preparing QA documentation for third-party team handoffs
- Enabling autonomous LLM-driven test execution

## Quick Start

**One-command initialization**:
```bash
python scripts/init_qa_project.py <project-name> [output-directory]
```

**What gets created**:
- Directory structure (`tests/docs/`, `tests/e2e/`, `tests/fixtures/`)
- Tracking CSVs (`TEST-EXECUTION-TRACKING.csv`, `BUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.csv`)
- Documentation templates (`BASELINE-METRICS.md`, `WEEKLY-PROGRESS-REPORT.md`)
- Master QA Prompt for autonomous execution
- README with complete quickstart guide

**For autonomous execution** (recommended): See `references/master_qa_prompt.md` - single copy-paste command for 100x speedup.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. QA Project Initialization

Initialize complete QA infrastructure with all templates:

```bash
python scripts/init_qa_project.py <project-name> [output-directory]
```

Creates directory structure, tracking CSVs, documentation templates, and master prompt for autonomous execution.

**Use when**: Starting QA from scratch or migrating to structured QA process.

### 2. Test Case Writing

Write standardized, reproducible test cases following AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert):

1. Read template: `assets/templates/TEST-CASE-TEMPLATE.md`
2. Follow structure: Prerequisites (Arrange) → Test Steps (Act) → Expected Results (Assert)
3. Assign priority: P0 (blocker) → P4 (low)
4. Include edge cases and potential bugs

**Test case format**: TC-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER] (e.g., TC-CLI-001, TC-WEB-042, TC-SEC-007)

**Reference**: See `references/google_testing_standards.md` for complete AAA pattern guidelines and coverage thresholds.

### 3. Test Execution & Tracking

**Ground Truth Principle** (critical):
- **Test case documents** (e.g., `02-CLI-TEST-CASES.md`) = **authoritative source** for test steps
- **Tracking CSV** = execution status only (do NOT trust CSV for test specifications)
- See `references/ground_truth_principle.md` for preventing doc/CSV sync issues

**Manual execution**:
1. Read test case from category document (e.g., `02-CLI-TEST-CASES.md`) ← **always start here**
2. Execute test steps exactly as documented
3. Update `TEST-EXECUTION-TRACKING.csv` **immediately** after EACH test (never batch)
4. File bug in `BUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.csv` if test fails

**Autonomous execution** (recommended):
1. Copy master prompt from `references/master_qa_prompt.md`
2. Paste to LLM session
3. LLM auto-executes, auto-tracks, auto-files bugs, auto-generates reports

**Innovation**: 100x faster vs manual + zero human error in tracking + auto-resume capability.

### 4. Bug Reporting

File bugs with proper severity classification:

**Required fields**:
- Bug ID: Sequential (BUG-001, BUG-002, ...)
- Severity: P0 (24h fix) → P4 (optional)
- Steps to Reproduce: Numbered, specific
- Environment: OS, versions, configuration

**Severity classification**:
- **P0 (Blocker)**: Security vulnerability, core functionality broken, data loss
- **P1 (Critical)**: Major feature broken with workaround
- **P2 (High)**: Minor feature issue, edge case
- **P3 (Medium)**: Cosmetic issue
- **P4 (Low)**: Documentation typo

**Reference**: See `BUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.csv` for complete template with examples.

### 5. Quality Metrics Calculation

Calculate comprehensive QA metrics and quality gates status:

```bash
python scripts/calculate_metrics.py <path/to/TEST-EXECUTION-TRACKING.csv>
```

**Metrics dashboard includes**:
- Test execution progress (X/Y tests, Z% complete)
- Pass rate (passed/executed %)
- Bug analysis (unique bugs, P0/P1/P2 breakdown)
- Quality gates status (✅/❌ for each gate)

**Quality gates** (all must pass for release):
| Gate | Target | Blocker |
|------|--------|---------|
| Test Execution | 100% | Yes |
| Pass Rate | ≥80% | Yes |
| P0 Bugs | 0 | Yes |
| P1 Bugs | ≤5 | Yes |
| Code Coverage | ≥80% | Yes |
| Security | 90% OWASP | Yes |

### 6. Progress Reporting

Generate QA reports for stakeholders:

**Daily summary** (end-of-day):
- Tests executed, pass rate, bugs filed
- Blockers (or None)
- Tomorrow's plan

**Weekly report** (every Friday):
- Use template: `WEEKLY-PROGRESS-REPORT.md` (created by init script)
- Compare against baseline: `BASELINE-METRICS.md`
- Assess quality gates and trends

**Reference**: See `references/llm_prompts_library.md` for 30+ ready-to-use reporting prompts.

### 7. Security Testing (OWASP)

Implement OWASP Top 10 security testing:

**Coverage targets**:
1. **A01: Broken Access Control** - RLS bypass, privilege escalation
2. **A02: Cryptographic Failures** - Token encryption, password hashing
3. **A03: Injection** - SQL injection, XSS, command injection
4. **A04: Insecure Design** - Rate limiting, anomaly detection
5. **A05: Security Misconfiguration** - Verbose errors, default credentials
6. **A07: Authentication Failures** - Session hijacking, CSRF
7. **Others**: Data integrity, logging, SSRF

**Target**: 90% OWASP coverage (9/10 threats mitigated).

Each security test follows AAA pattern with specific attack vectors documented.

## Day 1 Onboarding

For new QA engineers joining a project, complete 5-hour onboarding guide:

**Read**: `references/day1_onboarding.md`

**Timeline**:
- Hour 1: Environment setup (database, dev server, dependencies)
- Hour 2: Documentation review (test strategy, quality gates)
- Hour 3: Test data setup (users, CLI, DevTools)
- Hour 4: Execute first test case
- Hour 5: Team onboarding & Week 1 planning

**Checkpoint**: By end of Day 1, environment running, first test executed, ready for Week 1.

## Autonomous Execution (⭐ Recommended)

Enable LLM-driven autonomous QA testing with single master prompt:

**Read**: `references/master_qa_prompt.md`

**Features**:
- Auto-resume from last completed test (reads tracking CSV)
- Auto-execute test cases (Week 1-5 progression)
- Auto-track results (updates CSV after each test)
- Auto-file bugs (creates bug reports for failures)
- Auto-generate reports (daily summaries, weekly reports)
- Auto-escalate P0 bugs (stops testing, notifies stakeholders)

**Benefits**:
- 100x faster execution vs manual
- Zero human error in tracking
- Consistent bug documentation
- Immediate progress visibility

**Usage**: Copy master prompt, paste to LLM, let it run autonomously for 5 weeks.

## Adapting for Your Project

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Starting Fresh QA
```
1. python scripts/init_qa_project.py my-app ./
2. Fill in BASELINE-METRICS.md (document current state)
3. Write test cases using assets/templates/TEST-CASE-TEMPLATE.md
4. Copy master prompt from references/master_qa_prompt.md
5. Paste to LLM → autonomous execution begins
```

### Pattern 2: LLM-Driven Testing (Autonomous)
```
1. Read references/master_qa_prompt.md
2. Copy the single master prompt (one paragraph)
3. Paste to LLM conversation
4. LLM executes all 342 test cases over 5 weeks
5. LLM updates tracking CSVs automatically
6. LLM generates weekly reports automatically
```

### Pattern 3: Adding Security Testing
```
1. Read references/google_testing_standards.md (OWASP section)
2. Write TC-SEC-XXX test cases for each OWASP threat
3. Target 90% coverage (9/10 threats)
4. Document mitigations in test cases
```

### Pattern 4: Third-Party QA Handoff
```
1. Ensure all templates populated
2. Verify BASELINE-METRICS.md complete
3. Package tests/docs/ folder
4. Include references/master_qa_prompt.md for autonomous execution
5. QA team can start immediately (Day 1 onboarding → 5 weeks testing)
```
