description: "Consolidates redundant documentation while preserving all valuable content. This skill should be used when users want to clean up documentation bloat, merge redundant docs, reduce documentation sprawl, or consolidate multiple files covering the same topic. Triggers include \"clean up docs\", \"consolidate documentation\", \"too many doc files\", \"merge these docs\", or when documentation exceeds 500 lines across multiple files covering similar topics."

# Documentation Cleaner

Consolidate redundant documentation while preserving 100% of valuable content.

## Core Principle

**Critical evaluation before deletion.** Never blindly delete. Analyze each section's unique value before proposing removal. The goal is reduction without information loss.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery

1. Identify all documentation files covering the topic
2. Count total lines across files
3. Map content overlap between documents

### Phase 2: Value Analysis

For each document, create a section-by-section analysis table:

| Section | Lines | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| API Reference | 25 | Keep | Unique endpoint documentation |
| Setup Steps | 40 | Condense | Verbose but essential |
| Test Results | 30 | Delete | One-time record, not reference |

Value categories:
- **Keep**: Unique, essential, frequently referenced
- **Condense**: Valuable but verbose
- **Delete**: Duplicate, one-time, self-evident, outdated

See `references/value_analysis_template.md` for detailed criteria.

### Phase 3: Consolidation Plan

Propose target structure:

```
Before: 726 lines (3 files, high redundancy)
After:  ~100 lines (1 file + reference in CLAUDE.md)
Reduction: 86%
Value preserved: 100%
```

### Phase 4: Execution

1. Create consolidated document with all valuable content
2. Delete redundant source files
3. Update references (CLAUDE.md, README, imports)
4. Verify no broken links

## Value Preservation Checklist

Before finalizing, confirm preservation of:

- [ ] Essential procedures (setup, configuration)
- [ ] Key constraints and gotchas
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Technical debt / roadmap items
- [ ] External links and references
- [ ] Debug tips and code snippets

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Blind deletion | Loses valuable information | Section-by-section analysis first |
| Keeping everything | No reduction achieved | Apply value criteria strictly |
| Multiple sources of truth | Future divergence | Single authoritative location |
| Orphaned references | Broken links | Update all references after consolidation |

## Output Artifacts

A successful cleanup produces:

1. **Consolidated document** - Single source of truth
2. **Value analysis** - Section-by-section justification
3. **Before/after metrics** - Lines reduced, value preserved
4. **Updated references** - CLAUDE.md or README with pointer to new location
