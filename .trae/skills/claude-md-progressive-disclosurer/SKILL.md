# CLAUDE.md Progressive Disclosure Optimizer

Analyze and optimize user CLAUDE.md files to reduce context overhead while preserving functionality.

## Quick Start

1. **Backup** the original file first
2. **Audit** the current state (list all sections with line counts)
3. **Classify** each section using the criteria below
4. **Propose** optimizations with before/after comparison table
5. **Verify** information completeness checklist before executing
6. **Execute** approved changes
7. **Test** that moved content remains discoverable

## Section Classification

Analyze each section and classify:

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Keep in CLAUDE.md** | Core principles, short rules (<10 lines), frequently needed | Keep as-is |
| **Move to references/** | Detailed procedures, code examples, troubleshooting guides | Create `~/.claude/references/<name>.md` |
| **Extract to skill** | Reusable workflows, scripts, domain-specific knowledge | Create skill in skills repository |
| **Remove** | Duplicates existing skills, outdated, or unnecessary | Delete after confirmation |

### Exceptions to Size Guidelines

Even if a section is >50 lines, **KEEP in CLAUDE.md** if any of these apply:

| Exception | Reason | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Safety-critical** | Consequences of forgetting are severe | Deployment protocols, "never force push to main" |
| **High-frequency** | Referenced in most conversations | Core development patterns, common commands |
| **Easy to violate** | Claude tends to ignore when not visible | Code style rules, permission requirements |
| **Security-sensitive** | Must be always enforced | Production access restrictions, data handling rules |

**Rule of thumb**: If forgetting the rule could cause production incidents, data loss, or security breaches, keep it visible regardless of length.

## Optimization Workflow

### Step 0: Backup Original File

**CRITICAL**: Always create a backup before any changes.

```bash
# Create timestamped backup
cp ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# For project-level CLAUDE.md
cp CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

If issues found after optimization:
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.bak.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

### Step 1: Audit Current State

```
Task Progress:
- [ ] Create backup (Step 0)
- [ ] Read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Count total lines
- [ ] List all ## sections with line counts
- [ ] Identify sections >20 lines
```

### Step 2: Classify Each Section

For each section >20 lines, determine:

1. **Frequency**: How often is this information needed?
2. **Complexity**: Does it contain code blocks, tables, or detailed steps?
3. **Reusability**: Could other users benefit from this as a skill?

### Step 3: Propose Changes

Present optimization plan in this format:

```markdown
## Optimization Proposal

**Current**: X lines
**After**: Y lines (Z% reduction)

| Section | Lines | Action | Destination |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Section A | 50 | Move to references | ~/.claude/references/section_a.md |
| Section B | 80 | Extract to skill | skill-name/ |
| Section C | 5 | Keep | - |
```

### Step 3.5: Pre-execution Verification Checklist

**CRITICAL**: Before executing any changes, verify information completeness.

For each section being moved or modified:

1. **Extract key items** to verify:
   - Credentials/passwords/API keys
   - Critical rules ("never do X", "always do Y")
   - Specific values (ports, IPs, URLs, paths)
   - Code snippets that are frequently referenced
   - Cross-references to other sections

2. **Create verification checklist**:
   ```markdown
   ## Verification Checklist for [Section Name]

   | Key Item | Original Location | New Location | Verified |
   |----------|-------------------|--------------|----------|
   | Server IP 47.96.x.x | Line 123 | infrastructure.md:15 | [ ] |
   | "Never push to main" rule | Line 45 | Kept in CLAUDE.md | [ ] |
   | Login credentials | Line 200 | api-login.md:30 | [ ] |
   ```

3. **Check cross-references**:
   - If Section A references Section B, ensure links work after moving
   - Update any relative paths to absolute paths if needed

### Step 4: Execute Changes

After user approval AND verification checklist complete:

1. Create reference files in `~/.claude/references/`
2. Update CLAUDE.md with pointers to moved content
3. Create skills if applicable
4. **Verify each checklist item exists in new location**
5. Report final line count

### Step 5: Post-optimization Testing

Verify that Claude can still discover moved content:

1. **Test discoverability** - Ask questions that require moved content:
   ```
   Test queries to run:
   - "How do I connect to the production database?"
   - "What are the deployment steps for [service]?"
   - "Show me the credentials for [system]"
   ```

2. **Verify pointer functionality** - Each "See `reference.md`" link should work:
   ```bash
   # Check all referenced files exist
   grep -oh '`~/.claude/references/[^`]*`' ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md | \
     sed 's/`//g' | while read f; do
       eval test -f "$f" && echo "✓ $f" || echo "✗ MISSING: $f"
     done
   ```

3. **Compare with backup** - Ensure no unintended deletions:
   ```bash
   diff ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.bak.* ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md | grep "^<" | head -20
   ```

4. **Document results**:
   ```markdown
   ## Optimization Results

   | Metric | Before | After |
   |--------|--------|-------|
   | Total lines | X | Y |
   | Reduction | - | Z% |
   | References created | - | N files |
   | Skills extracted | - | M skills |

   **Verification**: All N checklist items verified ✓
   **Testing**: All K test queries returned correct information ✓
   ```

## Reference File Format

When moving content to `~/.claude/references/`:

```markdown
# [Section Title]

[Full original content, possibly enhanced with additional examples]
```

## CLAUDE.md Pointer Format

Replace moved sections with:

```markdown
## [Section Title]

[One-line summary]. See `~/.claude/references/[filename].md`
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep core principles visible**: Rules like "never do X" should stay in CLAUDE.md
- **Group related references**: Combine small related sections into one reference file
- **Preserve quick commands**: Keep frequently-used command snippets in CLAUDE.md
- **Test after optimization**: Ensure Claude can still find moved information

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Infrastructure/Credentials
**Before**: Full API examples, deployment scripts, server lists
**After**: One-line pointer to `~/.claude/references/infrastructure.md`

### Pattern: Code Generation Rules
**Before**: 50+ lines of coding standards with examples
**After**: Keep bullet-point rules, move examples to references

### Pattern: Reusable Workflows
**Before**: Complete scripts embedded in CLAUDE.md
**After**: Extract to skill with scripts/ directory

## Project-Level vs User-Level CLAUDE.md

This skill handles both types, but strategies differ:

### User-Level (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Reference location** | `~/.claude/references/` |
| **Scope** | Personal preferences, global rules |
| **Sharing** | Not shared, personal only |
| **Size target** | 100-200 lines ideal |

### Project-Level (`/path/to/project/CLAUDE.md`)

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Reference location** | `docs/` or `.claude/` in project root |
| **Scope** | Project-specific patterns, architecture |
| **Sharing** | Committed to git, shared with team |
| **Size target** | 300-600 lines acceptable (more project context needed) |

### Key Differences

1. **Reference paths**: Use relative paths for project-level (`docs/best-practices/`)
2. **Git considerations**: Project references are versioned with code
3. **Team alignment**: Project CLAUDE.md should reflect team consensus
4. **Update frequency**: Project-level changes more often as code evolves

### Project-Level Pointer Format

```markdown
## [Section Title]

[Summary]. See `docs/06-best-practices/[topic].md`
```

**Note**: For project CLAUDE.md, prefer `docs/` over hidden directories for discoverability by human team members.
